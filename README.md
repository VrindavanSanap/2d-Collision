## Collisions in One and Two Dimensions (Markdown)

Collisions are a fundamental concept in physics, where two objects interact over a short period of time. Here, we'll explore the differences between collisions in one dimension (1D) and two dimensions (2D), assuming objects with equal mass.

**1D Collisions**

Imagine two objects moving on a straight line. In a 1D collision, the objects' motion is entirely described by their speed along this line. Here's the key takeaway:

- **Swapping Velocities:** After a 1D collision, the objects simply swap their velocities. The faster object slows down to the speed of the slower object before the collision, and vice versa.

**2D Collisions**

Now, consider objects moving in a plane (imagine a pool table). A 2D collision introduces a new aspect: direction. Here's how the components of velocity are affected:

- **Tangential Component:** This is the velocity component along the line tangent (touching) the point of collision. In a 2D collision, the tangential components of the objects' velocities **remain unchanged**.
- **Normal Component:** This is the velocity component perpendicular to the point of collision, like the direction a ball bounces off a wall. In a 2D collision, the normal components of the objects' velocities **swap signs**, similar to a 1D collision.

Think of it this way: the tangential component represents how the objects were moving "sideways" relative to the collision point, and this isn't affected by the direct impact. The normal component, however, reflects the head-on interaction, causing them to bounce off each other and reverse their direction in that plane.

By analyzing both components after a 2D collision, we can determine the final directions and speeds of the objects.
